  <h4><a name="What is yoga"></a>What is yoga?</h4>

<p style="width: 484px;">
The Indian sage Patanjali is believed to have collated the practice of yoga into the Yoga Sutra an estimated 2,000 years ago. It also outlines eight limbs of yoga: the yamas (restraints), niyamas (observances), asana (postures), pranayama (breathing), pratyahara (withdrawal of senses), dharana (concentration), dhyani (meditation), and samadhi (absorption). As we explore these eight limbs, we begin by refining our behavior in the outer world, and then we focus inwardly until we reach samadhi (liberation, enlightenment).<br><br>

Today most people practicing yoga are engaged in the third limb, asana, which is a program of physical postures designed to purify the body and mind. This practice helps the person attain a state of health, wellbeing and youthfulness. Sue designs her classes so that they are fun and enjoyable and participants feel more positive at the end of a class.</p>

<h4><a name="Religion"></a>Is yoga a religion?</h4>

<p style="width: 484px;">
Yoga is not a religion. It is a philosophy that began in India an estimated 2000 years ago. Yoga provides a framework for spiritual growth and mastery over the physical and mental body. Yoga sometimes interweaves other philosophies such as Hinduism or Buddhism, but it is not necessary to study those in order to practice or yoga. In fact it is not at all necessary to take on or surrender any religious beliefs to take up yoga.

<h4><a name="Exercise"></a>Is yoga different from stretching or other kinds of exercise?</h4>

<p style="width: 484px;">Unlike stretching or fitness, yoga is more than just physical postures. Yoga is unique because we connect the movement of the body and the fluctuations of the mind to the rhythm of our breath. Connecting the mind, body, and breath helps us to direct our attention inward. Through this process of inward attention, we learn to recognize our habitual thought patterns without labeling them, judging them, or trying to change them. We become more aware of our experiences from moment to moment. The awareness that we cultivate is what helps us become much more flexible in body and in mind.
</p>

<h4><a name="Flexible"></a>I'm not flexible — can I do yoga?</h4>

<p style="width: 484px;">Yes! You are a perfect candidate for yoga. Many people think that they need to be flexible to begin yoga, but that's a little bit like thinking that you need to be able to play tennis in order to take tennis lessons. Come as you are and you will find that yoga practice will help you become more flexible.

This newfound agility will be balanced by strength, coordination, and enhanced cardiovascular health, as well as a sense of physical confidence and overall well-being</p>

<h4><a name="Many"></a>How many times per week should I practice?</h4>

<p style="width: 484px;">Yoga is amazing — even if you only practice for one hour a week, you will experience the benefits of the practice. If you can do more than that, you will certainly experience more benefits. Sue holds classes the north Birmingham/West Midlands area and doing more than one class a week is very feasible. You will likely find that the gains you get from yoga makes you want to keep a regular ongoing practice.</p>

<div style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back
to top</a></div>

<h4><a name="Eating"></a>Why can I not eat at least 2 hours before class?</h4>

<p style="width: 484px;">In yoga practice we twist from side to side, turn upside down, and bend forward and backward. If you have not fully digested your last meal, it will make itself known to you in ways that are not comfortable. If you are a person with a fast-acting digestive system and are afraid you might get hungry or feel weak during yoga class, experiment with a light snack such as yogurt, a few nuts, or juice about 30 minutes to an hour before class.</p>

<div style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back
to top</a></div>

<h4><a name="Need"></a>What do I need to attend a class?</h4>

<p style="width: 484px;">All you really need to begin practicing yoga is your body, your mind, and a yoga mat. But it is also helpful to have a pair of sweat pants, leggings, or shorts, and a t-shirt that's not too baggy. No special footgear is required because you will be barefoot. It might be nice to bring a towel to class with you.</p>

<div style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back
to top</a></div>

<h4><a name="Condition"></a>What if I have a medical condition?</h4>

<p style="width: 484px;">If you have an injury or a medical condition that may affect your ability to do the different physical postures, make sure you let Sue know before the class begins or call her in advance to discuss your situation. It’s also highly advisable that you get the go ahead from your GP or doctor before you start taking yoga classes. In most cases, Sue will be able to suggest modifications to the poses to suit your needs. </p>

<div style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back

<h4><a name="Style"></a>What style of yoga does Sue teach?</h4>

<p style="width: 484px;">There are many styles of yoga and Sue teaches Hatha Yoga. Hatha yoga refers to a set of physical exercises (known as asanas or postures), and sequences of asanas, designed to align your skin, muscles, and bones. The postures are also designed to open the many channels of the body — especially the main channel, the spine — so that energy can flow freely.<br><br>

Hatha yoga is a path toward creating balance and uniting opposites. In our physical bodies we develop a balance of strength and flexibility. We also learn to balance our effort and relaxation in each pose and to still the fluctuations of the mind.</p>
